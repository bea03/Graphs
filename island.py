Islands Matrix Problem

Write a function that takes a 2D binary array and returns the number of 1 islands. 
An island consists of 1s that are connected to the north, south, east or west. For example:

islands = [[0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
           [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
           [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
           [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
           [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]
island_counter(islands) # returns 4
what are nodes: 1
edges: connected n/s/e/w

an island = 1s cluster connected by nsew (connected components)

build graph, def get neighbors()
